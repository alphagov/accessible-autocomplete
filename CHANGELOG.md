We recommend you update to the latest release using npm:

### Breaking changes

You must make the following change when you migrate to this release, or your service may break.

#### Migrate to the new accessible focus state

The focus state [now meets the new WCAG 2.1 level AA requirements](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/weve-made-the-gov-uk-design-system-more-accessible/).

You do not need to do anything if you’re using Sass.

If you’ve previously copied CSS from our code into your project, you must copy all the CSS from our [`accessible-autocomplete.min.css` file](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete/blob/v2.0.0/dist/accessible-autocomplete.min.css) into your CSS file.

If you’ve created custom CSS, you should check that your component meets WCAG 2.1 level AA requirements. You can [read how we made the GOV.UK Design System focus states accessible](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/focus-states/).

[Pull request #360: Update focus styles to meet WCAG 2.1 level AA non-text contrast requirements](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete/pull/360).

### Fixes

#### Better compatibility with screen readers

The input field is now visible to all screen readers, because the input field now meets the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) 1.0 standard instead of ARIA 1.1. ARIA 1.0 is better supported by the current versions of most screen readers.

Screen readers will now consistently tell users:

- when users have entered too few characters in the input field
- the correct number of search results, and what the results are
- which result users have highlighted
- how to use autocomplete in different screen readers - by reading hidden hint text

Screen readers will also now avoid telling users information they do not need to know after they highlight an option.

Thanks to [Mark Hunter](https://github.com/markhunter27), Chris Moore and everyone at HMRC who worked on these improvements.
