## What's this?

This describes the necessary behaviours that a typeahead (referred in this document as an "autocomplete") needs to meet to be usable by assistive technologies.

They are useful if you are evaluating `accessible-typeahead`, or a different autocomplete solution.

## User story

> As an Assistive Technology (AT) user, I want to be able to search using autocomplete, so I can find and choose a matching result easily and accurately.

## Acceptance criteria

The field with autocomplete must:

- Be focusable with a keyboard
- Indicate when it has keyboard focus
- Inform the user that it is an editable field
- Inform the user if there is a pre-filled value
- Inform the user that autocomplete is available
- Explain how to use autocomplete
- Inform the user that content has been expanded
- Inform the user that N number of matches have been displayed
- Inform the user as the number of matches changes
- Enable the user to navigate the available matches using touch or keyboard
- Inform the user when a match is selected
- (Optional) Inform the user which number the currently selected match is (1 of 3 for example)
- Inform the user if a match is pre-selected
- Enable the user to confirm the selected match
- Inform the user when a match is confirmed
- Return focus to the editable field when a selected match is confirmed

Helpful definitions:

- `navigate`: When the user selects between matches
- `selected`: When one of the matches is highlighted, and ready to be confirmed, for example by pressing `enter`
- `pre-selected`: When an item is selected on the user's behalf without them navigating to it
- `confirmed`: When one of the matches has been confirmed, and will be submitted as a value of the parent form
